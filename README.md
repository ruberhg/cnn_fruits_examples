# CNN-based examples for fruit classification

These codes were implemented as part of the paper "A Review of Convolutional Neural Network Applied to Fruit Image Processing" Applied Sciences, 10(10): 3443 (2020), https://doi.org/10.3390/app10103443).

In order to illustrate the use of some available tools to develop a CNN, we show the implementation of examples for fruit classification and quality control. Additionally, the same examples were implemented using well-known pre-trained models in order to illustrate another solution perspective using transfer learning. It is important to remember that the objective of these examples is only to show in the simplest way how to implement CNN models for a specific task. For this reason, the proposed examples were not optimized and very simple solutions are proposed aiming to they can be easily understood. For results comparison and discusion, you can read our paper.

The implementations were coded in Python and MATLAB, by using TensorFlow [99] and the Deep Learning Toolbox [102], respectively. The source codes were commented with descriptive information and they are also available online at the website of our Laboratory LITRP (http://www.litrp.cl/repository.html).
