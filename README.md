# CNN-based examples for fruit classification

In order to illustrate the use of some available tools to develop a CNN, following we show the implementation of two examples for fruit classification. The implementations was coded in Python and MATLAB, by using TensorFlow and the Deep Learning Toolbox, respectively. These codes were implemented as part of the paper "A Review of Convolutional Neural Network Applied to Fruit Image Processing" Applied Sciences, 10(10): 3443 (2020), https://doi.org/10.3390/app10103443).
